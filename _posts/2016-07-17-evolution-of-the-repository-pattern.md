A listener from our podcast, [The Context](https://github.com/artem-zinnatullin/TheContext-Podcast), that Artem Zinnatullin and I run asked me, if I can give him an example of the Repository Pattern. So I googled around and stumbled upon some blog posts and found out that the term Repository Pattern is used and described in many different ways. In this blog post I want give you a brief history of the Repository Pattern and I want to discuss why I think the Repository Pattern could lead to over abstraction and over engineering.

Before we get started, I wanted to say that the term `Repository Pattern` is used and defined in different ways in different contexts and different programming languages. Therefore, I split this post into two parts: In the first part I want to discuss why I think the  "original" definition of the Repository Pattern is an over engineered abstraction you very very rarely need and in the second part I want to show a common and popular definition of the Repository Pattern that may be a better choice for the average use case.

# The original Repository Pattern
[This blog post](https://medium.com/@krzychukosobudzki/repository-design-pattern-bc490b256006#.h7cm2b24q) by Krzychu Kosobudzki or [this blog post](http://panavtec.me/what-is-the-repository-pattern-and-why-im-not-going-to-use-it-on-android) Christian Panadero describes this pattern quite good. In my opinion the original repository pattern is a over engineered abstraction layer you very very rarely need. Especially on Android. What do I mean with over engineered? Let's have a look at the example from Krzychu Kosobudzki's blog post:

```java
interface Repository<T> {
    void add(T item);
    void remove(Specification specification);
    List<T> query(Specification specification);
}
```

What is the `Specification` type? Basically `Specification` is just an interface like this:

```java
interface Specification { }

interface SqlSpecification extends Specification {
    String toSqlQuery();
}
```

Then we could have concrete `Specification` to query all list of `News` from SqliteDatabase, ordered by date, like this:

```java
class NewestNewsesSqlSpecification implements SqlSpecification {

    @Override
    public String toSqlQuery() {
        return String.format(
                "SELECT * FROM %1$s ORDER BY `%2$s` DESC;",
                NewsTable.TABLE_NAME,
                NewsTable.Fields.DATE
        );
    }
}
```

Another example of a `Specification` shows the following:

```java
public class NewsByIdSqlSpecification implements SqlSpecification {
    private int id;

    public NewsByIdSpecification(final int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    @Override
    public String toSqlQuery() {
        return String.format(
                "SELECT * FROM %1$s WHERE `%2$s` = %3$d';",
                NewsTable.TABLE_NAME,
                NewsTable.Fields.ID,
                id
        );
    }
}
```

And then use that components like this:

```java
public class NewsSqlRepository implements Repository<News> {

    @Override
    public List<News> query(Specification specification) {
        SqlSpecification sqlSpecification = (SqlSpecification) specification;

        SQLiteDatabase database = openHelper.getReadableDatabase();
        List<News> newses = new ArrayList<>();

        Cursor cursor = database.rawQuery(sqlSpecification.toSqlQuery());

        for (int i = 0, size = cursor.getCount(); i < size; i++) {
            cursor.moveToPosition(i);
            newses.add(toNewsMapper.map(cursor));
        }
        cursor.close();
        return newses;
    }
}
```

Again, all code snipped shown above are borrowed from [Krzychu Kosobudzki blog post](https://medium.com/@krzychukosobudzki/repository-design-pattern-bc490b256006#.h7cm2b24q).


Usually you use `NewsRepository` i.e. in your Presenter (MVP) or use case / interactor if you are following the clean architecture like this: `newsRepository.query(new NewestNewsesSqlSpecification())`.

So far so good. Before we continue, I want to ask you two essential questions:

First question: **Why and when do we use the repository pattern?** I want to link to the book [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html) by Martin Fowler et al.

> The Repository will carry out the appropriate operations behind the scenes. Conceptually, a Repository encapsulates the set of objects persisted in a data store and the operations performed over them, providing a more object-oriented view of the persistence layer. Repository also supports the objective of achieving a clean separation and one-way dependency between the domain and data mapping layers.

Second Question: **What are the benefits of abstractions like `Specification`?**

 - Single responsibility: This class is responsible to create a "criteria". In the case of `NewestNewsesSqlSpecification` this criteria is translated to an SQL string.
 - Hide implementation details: The SQL Statement is hidden in `NewestNewsesSqlSpecification`, so that no other class has to know about SQL at all.
 - We can reuse Specifiations: Imagine a Specification with a SQL WHERE clause. We could define such a Specification once and reuse it whenever we need such different WHERE clause based specifications.


 What are the disadvantages with that extra abstraction layer?
 Well, now whoever calls `newsRepository.query(new NewestNewsesSqlSpecification())` has to know which `Specification` to pass in. Furthermore, developers begin to over abstract that pattern again. For Example, Krzychu Kosobudzki says that with the repository pattern we can change concrete implementation as requirements changes. He gives the example of using Realm instead of SQLite database:

```java
 public class NewsRealmRepository implements Repository<News> {

    @Override
    public List<News> query(Specification specification) {
        RealmSpecification realmSpecification = (RealmSpecification) specification;

        Realm realm = Realm.getInstance(realmConfiguration);
        RealmResults<NewsRealm> realmResults = realmSpecification.toRealmResults(realm);

        List<News> newses = new ArrayList<>();

        for (NewsRealm news : realmResults) {
            newses.add(toNewsMapper.map(news));
        }
        realm.close();
        return newses;
    }
}
```

As you see there is another subtype of `Specification` for Realm:

```java
public interface RealmSpecification extends Specification {
    RealmResults<NewsRealm> toRealmResults(Realm realm);
}

public class NewsByIdSpecification implements RealmSpecification {
    private final int id;

    public NewsByIdSpecification(final int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    @Override
    public RealmResults<NewsRealm> toRealmResults(Realm realm) {
        return realm.where(NewsRealm.class)
                .equalTo(NewsRealm.Fields.ID, id)
                .findAll();
    }
}
```

The problem is, that whoever calls `newsRepository.query(...)` has to know whether it has to pass in a `NewestNewsesSqlSpecification` or `NewestNewsesRealmSpecification`. So is it really that easy to change your implementation from SQLite to Realm? No, it's not because you have to change the specifications everywhere from `FooSqlSpecification` to `FooRealmSpecification`. There is also one big code smell coming along with this:

```java
@Override
public List<News> query(Specification specification) {
  SqlSpecification sqlSpecification = (SqlSpecification) specification;
  ...
}
```

```java
@Override
public List<News> query(Specification specification) {
  RealmSpecification realmSpecification = (RealmSpecification) specification;
  ...
}
```

Whenever you are programming against an interface but you have to cast an interface to a concrete class, in 95% you are doing something wrong!

Martin Fowler et al. don't make a statement about Repository Pattern and changing concrete implementation (i.e. SQLite to Realm). Fowler et al, describe the repository pattern  as

 > adding this layer helps minimize duplicate query logic.

So the original definition of the repository pattern is all about minimizing duplicate query logic and not necessarily to build an abstraction layer to change the underlying database.

I don't want to blame anybody. This is not a Android related problem, we also see that quite often in Java EE world, especially in spring framework powered backends.


# Evolution of the Repository Pattern term
In android development the term Repository Pattern is quite often used in combination with Clean Architecture. So did Fernando Cejas in his excellent blog post [Architecting Androidâ€¦The clean way?](http://fernandocejas.com/2014/09/03/architecting-android-the-clean-way/) (scroll down to "Data layer" section). Interesting enough, he also links to the original definition of the Repository Pattern by Martin Fowler et al. However, Fernando Cejas says:

> All data needed for the application comes from this layer through a Repository implementation (the interface is in the domain layer) that uses a Repository Pattern with a strategy that, through a factory, picks different data sources depending on certain conditions.

![Repository Pattern](/images/repository_pattern.png)

> The idea behind all this is that the data origin is transparent for the client, which does not care if the data is coming from memory, disk or the cloud, the only truth is that the data will arrive and will be got.

As you can see here, the term `Repository Pattern` is used to describe something slightly different. You can see it even more clear if you check out Fernando's [Clean Architecture Sample Project](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture/tree/master/data/src/main/java/com/fernandocejas/android10/sample/data/repository) on Github. In his sample he uses RxJava. For my blog post I have removed RxJava in the code snippets below for better understanding if you don't have prior RxJava knowledge. I have also simplified the code a little bit to focus on the important things. For example Fernando wants to load an User by his id:

```java
interface UserRepository {
  User user(int userId);
}
```

The concrete implementation of that repository:

```java
class UserDataRepository implements UserRepository {

  private UserDataStoreFactory userDataStoreFactory;

  @Override
  public User user(int userId) {
    UserDataStore userDataStore = userDataStoreFactory.create(userId);
    return userDataStore.get(userId);
  }
}
```

An `UserDataStore` is, as the name already suggests, responsible to load a User from a store like Disk or a backend (cloud).

```java
interface UserDataStore {
  User getUser(int userId);
}

class DiskUserDataStore implements UserDataStore {
  private DiskCache<Int, User> userCache;

  @Override
  public User getUser(int userId){
    return userCache.get(userId);
  }
}

class CloudUserDataStore implements UserDataStore {
  @Override
  public User getUser(int userId){
    // Make an HTTP request and return User.
  }
}
```

`UserDataStoreFactory` is the component that decides which `UserDataStore` to use when someone calls `UserRepository.getUser(userId)`. For example the factory could check if `DiskUserDataStore` has a User and if the User object is expired then the factory returns `CloudUserDataStore`, otherwise `DiskUserDataStore`. The factory could also take into account if the smartphone  has an active internet connection or not. I guess you get the point.

# Conclusion
Fernando Cejas interpretation of the Repository Pattern is representative of other developers that nowadays interpret the Repository Pattern in a similar way. However, it has not much more in common with the "original" definition of the Repository Pattern by Martin Fowler et al. Wasn't the repository pattern not meant to be used to minimizing duplicate query logic? Martin Fowler didn't say anything about loading users from different UserDataStores. Where did the `Specification` class go?  This happens quite often in history. A name gets (re)used for different purpose. For example Trygve Reenskaug introduced Model-View-Controller in the 1970s but his definition has nothing in common with what we nowadays call MVC, i.e. describing Activities as Controller on android, UIController on iOS, Controller in backends and so on. The same happened to the term Repositoy Pattern.

No worries, evolution is good. We just should remember where the origin comes from and why it has evolved to what it is used now. The original Repository Pattern was designed for **Enterprise Applications** to reduce duplication of query logic. Usually, your android app is not a enterprise application. Normally in your android app you should follow Fernando Cejas definition of the Repository Pattern.

**But,** if you take a closer look at the later interpretation of the Repository Pattern you will come to the following conclusion: Basically it says, program against an interface so that you can change implementation details later and follow the single responsibility principle. That's what all the Clean Architecture and Repository Pattern blah blah is about.

Don't over abstract. Don't over engineer. For example, if you start an App from scratch, yes, you should define an interface like `UserRepo` and all your business logic or domain layer or whatever layer should program agains this interface. However, if you only have a backend to load data from, then your `UserRepo` implementation should make these http calls directly in this concrete UserRepo class. No need for `UserDataStore`, `CloudUserDataStore` and `UserDataStoreFactory`.

You may ask yourself: What if one day my requirements change and I have to use Realm instead of SQLite. Then you provide `UserRepoRealm implements UserRepo` instead of `UserRepoSql implements UserRepo`. Still no need for `UserDataStore` and `UserDataStoreFactory`. My message here is: build the minimal piece of code you really need and don't over engineer it with requirements that may or may not be needed in the future. Seriously, I'm working in this industry for quite some years now and I have never worked on a backend not to mention an android app that has ever changed the underlying database. Don't build an abstraction layer like `SqlSpecification` with such future requirements changes in mind. If one day you have to add something like a DiskCache along your cloud backend to communicate with, then it makes sense to refactor your code to respect the single responsibility principle and add classes like `UserDataStoreFactory`, `UserDataStore`, `DiskUserDataStore` and `CloudUserDataStore`. Since all your other layers are programming agains `UserRepo` interface, refactoring that changes later is no problem at all.

Until then, no need for all this abstraction.
