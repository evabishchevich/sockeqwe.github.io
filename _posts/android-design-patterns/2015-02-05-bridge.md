{% include android-design-patterns/intro.html %} This blog entry is about the **Adapter** pattern.


To clarify: this is not about _Adapters_ that are used with `ListView` or `RecyclerView`, even thought that the adpater pattern is applied here as well (hence the name).

What is the adapter pattern?
If you travel to another country and you want to charge your laptops battery you may have to use an adapter. So you have to put an AC Adapter between the socket-outlet and the charging cable. Exactly the same applies in software systems.
The main use is to provide access to legacy systems. A legacy system is an old system that that continues to be used, even though newer technology are now available, but we can not replace the legacy system because of some reasons like system cost.

For instance, consider we have a very complex android weather app. This weather app is connected to a third party weather service to get the current temperature in _Celsius_. Unfortunately, we have to replace the weather service with another weather service which returns _Fahrenheit_. Sadly we don't have time nor money to rewrite our android to work with the new weather service and _Fahrenheit_. At this point we can apply the **adapter pattern**. Before the using the new weather backend our app looks like this:

{% highlight java %}
public class MainActivity extends ActionBarActivity {

  private WeatherService weatherService = new WeatherService();

  @InjectView(R.id.temperature)
  TextView temperatureView;

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    ButterKnife.inject(this);

    double celsius = weatherService.getCurrentTemperature();
    temperatureView.setText(celsius+ " Â°C");
  }

}
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight java %}
public class WeatherService {

  private OldWeatherBackend backend = new OldWeatherBackend();

  public double getCurrentTemperature() {
    return backend.getCurrentTemperatureCelsius();
  }
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java %}
public class OldWeatherBackend {

  public double getCurrentTemperatureCelsius(){
    return 30;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we want to use the `NewWeatherBackend` instead:

{% highlight java %}
public class NewWeatherBackend {

  public double getCurrentTemperatureFahrenheit() {
    return 86;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Next we have to create an `CelsiusBackendAdapter`:
{% highlight java %}
public class CelsiusBackendAdapter extends OldWeatherBackend {

  private NewWeatherBackend newBackend;

  public CelsiusBackendAdapter(NewWeatherBackend newBackend) {
    this.newBackend = newBackend;
  }

  @Override public double getCurrentTemperatureCelsius() {
    double fahrenheit = newBackend.getCurrentTemperatureFahrenheit();
    double celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
    return celsius;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Finally we use `CelsiusBackendAdapter`:
{% highlight java %}
public class WeatherService {

  private OldWeatherBackend backend = new CelsiusBackendAdapter(new NewWeatherBackend());

  public double getCurrentTemperature() {
    return backend.getCurrentTemperatureCelsius();
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}


As you see, the **Adapter Pattern** uses **inheritance followed by delegation**. We extend from `OldWeatherBackend` _(inheritance)_ to provide the same API that we are already using. However, internally we override the public API and we are using `NewWeatherBackend` _(delegation)_.
