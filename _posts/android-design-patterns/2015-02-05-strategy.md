{% include android-design-patterns/intro.html %} This blog entry is about the **strategy** pattern.

The **strategy pattern** (also known as _policy pattern_) enables the selection of an algorithm at runtime. Let's say we have an android app with min sdk version = 9 (Gingerbread) and  target sdk version = 21 (Lolipop). Out app should animate a View out and replace it with another one. In gingerbread (API 9) we don't run an animation, but we simple set the `Visibility.GONE` and `Visibility.VISIBLE`. From Android 3.0 (API 11) until Android 4.4 (API 19) we use run crossfade animation (alpha) and with Android 5.0 (API 21) we use a _circular reveal animation_. Furthermore, we have noticed that the circular animation does not run very smooth on old devices that have updated recently to Android 5.0. Therefore those devices should also run the crossfade animation instead of the reveal animation, even if they are Android 5.0. For simplicity, we assume that an _"old device"_ is a device that has less then 4 CPU cores, for instance a dual core powered device is considered as an old device (`Runtime.availableProcessors() < 4`).

A simple ad hoc implementation could look like this:
{% highlight java %}
public class AdHocActivity extends ActionBarActivity {

  private final int ANIM_DURATION = 600;

  @InjectView(R.id.view1) View view1;
  @InjectView(R.id.view2) View view2;

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    ButterKnife.inject(this);
  }


  @SuppressLint("NewApi")
  @OnClick(R.id.button)
  public void onButtonClicked(){

    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < 11){
      view2.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
      view1.setVisibility(View.GONE);
    }
    else {

      int cores = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();

      if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 21 && cores >= 4){
        // Reveal Animation

        // get the center for the clipping circle
        int cx = (view2.getLeft() + view2.getRight()) / 2;
        int cy = (view2.getTop() + view2.getBottom()) / 2;

        // get the final radius for the clipping circle
        int finalRadius = Math.max(view2.getWidth(), view2.getHeight());

        // create the animator for this view (the start radius is zero)
        final Animator inAnim =
            ViewAnimationUtils.createCircularReveal(view2, cx, cy, 0, finalRadius);

        inAnim.addListener(new AnimatorListenerAdapter() {
          @Override public void onAnimationStart(Animator animation) {
            view1.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
            view2.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
          }

          @Override public void onAnimationEnd(Animator animation) {
            view1.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
          }
        });

        inAnim.setDuration(ANIM_DURATION).start();

      } else {

        // Crossfade animation
        AnimatorSet set = new AnimatorSet();
        set.playTogether(
            ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(view1, "alpha", 1f, 0f),
            ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(view2, "alpha", 0f, 1f)
        );

        set.addListener(new AnimatorListenerAdapter() {
          @Override public void onAnimationStart(Animator animation) {
            view1.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
            view2.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
          }

          @Override public void onAnimationEnd(Animator animation) {
            view1.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
          }
        });

        set.setDuration(ANIM_DURATION).start();

      }

    }

  }

}
{% endhighlight %}

While `AdHocActivity` works as expected and selects the correct animation at runtime we notice that we have written about 100 lines of code just for doing that animation staff. You can imagine if this would be a real app there will be much more code in your activity class and all of this `if-else` and animation code leads to complex code. Furthermore, the code is tightly coupled and we can not reuse it. To solve this problems we can apply the **strategy patter**.

As we have seen there are 3 strategies:
 1. `VisibilityStrategy`: Before API 11 (Honeycomb) we change the views visibility instead of running a animation.
 2. `CrossFadeStrategy`: Starting from API 11 we run a cross-fade animation. We also use this strategy if the device is to old (less than 4 cpu cores) to run a reveal animation.
 3. `RevealStrategy`: Run a circular reveal animation

Now we have to define a common interface for all strategies:

{% highlight java %}
public interface AnimationStrategy {

  public void animate(View in, View out);

}
{% endhighlight %}

Here are our concrete strategies:
{% highlight java %}
public class VisibilityStrategy implements AnimationStrategy {

  @Override
  public void animate(View in, View out) {
    in.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
    out.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java %}
public class CrossFadeStrategy implements AnimationStrategy {

  @TargetApi(11)
  @Override
  public void animate(final View in, final View out) {
    AnimatorSet set = new AnimatorSet();
    set.playTogether(
        ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(out, "alpha", 1f, 0f),
        ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(in, "alpha", 0f, 1f)
    );

    set.addListener(new AnimatorListenerAdapter() {
      @Override public void onAnimationStart(Animator animation) {
        out.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
        in.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
      }

      @Override public void onAnimationEnd(Animator animation) {
        out.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
      }
    });

    set.setDuration(ANIM_DURATION).start();
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight java %}
public class RevealStrategy implements AnimationStrategy {

  @TargetApi(21)
  @Override
  public void animate(final View in, final View out) {


    // get the center for the clipping circle
    int cx = (in.getLeft() + in.getRight()) / 2;
    int cy = (in.getTop() + in.getBottom()) / 2;

    // get the final radius for the clipping circle
    int finalRadius = Math.max(in.getWidth(), in.getHeight());

    // create the animator for this view (the start radius is zero)
    final Animator inAnim =
        ViewAnimationUtils.createCircularReveal(in, cx, cy, 0, finalRadius);

    inAnim.addListener(new AnimatorListenerAdapter() {
      @Override public void onAnimationStart(Animator animation) {
        out.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
        in.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
      }

      @Override public void onAnimationEnd(Animator animation) {
        out.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
      }
    });

    inAnim.setDuration(ANIM_DURATION).start();

  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

It should be pretty clear what we have done. We have refactored the code from `AdHocActivity` and put them into separted classes. Next we want to refactor the `if-else` checks and put them in a reusable and decoupled class called `AnimationPolicy`:



Let's say we want to sort an integer array. There are serval algorithmes for that like [Merge sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) and [Bubble sort]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort). While _Bubble sort_ is much slower than _Merge sort_, _Merge sort_ needs more space (memory) because it (typically) needs an additional array for the output. If our system don't have much memory we want to prefer _Bubble sort_ over _Merge sort_ and want to decide at runtime which one we select by checking the systems memory.
