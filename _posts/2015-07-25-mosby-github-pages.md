Exactly four months ago I have published a [blog post](http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/mosby/) to introduce Mosby, a Model-View-Presenter library for android.

Four months and 500 stars on Github later I have decided that it's time for Mosby to move out of home and move into his own house. Today I'm delighted to announce that Mosby now has it's own [Github Pages](http://hannesdorfmann.com/mosby/) as central resource for all Mosby related things like documentation, architectural explanations, sample code, getting started page and javadoc.

I got a lot of positive feedback from the community (have I ever said how much I love the android community) and also a few pull requests and contributions. I'm very glad to see that more android developers realize the need of a clear architecture in their android apps (doesn't have to be Mosby nor MVP in general). Hopefully, Mosby can help building better apps. At the same time I have seen that there are developers with a questions about MVP and especially Mosby. Some of those questions may not have been asked if there would be a central public documentation resource. Hence, the need of a own github page. Another problem was that people didn't know where the right place was to ask questions (me neither). Some asked by creating issues on github's issue tracker. Other asked in the comments section of my personal site. A few others on reddit. To address this issue I have also included a `Disqus` section to Mosby's github page. This section should be the right place to ask questions. However, I'm dreaming of the day that Mosby is popular enough so that the `Disqus` section can be dropped in favor of an own tag on stackoverflow.

This is not a farewell. I will still post about Mosby here on my personal blog. Those blog posts may also be merged into Mosby's Github Pages. Another advantage of Github Pages is that everybody can contribute easily by creating a pull request. Interior designers (aka. contributors) are very welcome!

Therefore, I'm not saying good bye Mosby. Rather I say _see you later_ in your new house, which hopefully one day will be the skyscraper you were always dreaming of.
