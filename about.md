My name is **Hannes Dorfmann** and I'm sofware engineer (mainly Android) and contributor of many open source projects. I'm Android lead developer at [Tickaroo](https://www.tickaroo.com). The most popular mobile app my team and I have built is for [kicker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netbiscuits.kicker) one of the most renowned football magazine in europe.
This is my personal blog where I publish technical articles about android, software architecture, user interfaces and user experience.
I'm a sports enthusiast. I love football (soccer).
